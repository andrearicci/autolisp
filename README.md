## survey
an autolisp routine that draws a triangle given three sides - to help with survey routines in acad.  
Please help me to make it with ghost-elastic preview!

## acaddoc.lsp

adding this line of code to your acaddoc.lsp file will show the current _insunits_ in the taskbar (converted to a readable format)

## stairs

here are two routines that are attempts to port [Dan E. Thomas'](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-forum/custom-stair-program/td-p/5606736) routine to meters and centimeters.
My wish is to merge them all in a routine able to scale by the variable `insunits` or though a simple question to the user.
